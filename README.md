## Overview

A central place for COMP8420 course materials: lecture notes, assignments, code, datasets, and reports. Replace this section with a concise description of the repository's purpose and scope.

## Repository structure

The repository is initially empty. Suggested structure:

- assignments/    - Assignment descriptions and starter code
- projects/       - Course projects and reports
- src/            - Source code
- data/           - Datasets (or links to large datasets)
- tests/          - Tests and test data
- README.md       - This file

Adjust the structure to match the course requirements.
